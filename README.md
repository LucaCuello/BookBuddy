# BookBuddy: Description

This project was created as a technical test for a job selection process. It was made entirely on VueJS 3 and TypeScript.
The project itself is a digital bookshelf where you can add books by name and author and immediately see them displayed on the page as virtual books. Once you have your book collection, you can choose to delete a book or mark it as read.
For this project I've learnt the basics of vue 3 composition api, eventhandlers, implementation of components and how to make animations using the native transition component.
